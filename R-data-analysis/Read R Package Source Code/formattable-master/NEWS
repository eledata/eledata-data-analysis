## Breaking changes

* `color_bar` is now broken into two versions using different transform functions:
  * `normalize_bar` uses `normalize`, the same as `color_bar` in previous versions
  * `proportion_bar` uses newly introduced `proportion` as `x / max(abs(x))` to
  create bars of proportional width. (#42, #49)
